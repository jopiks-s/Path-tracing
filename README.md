# Path-tracing

This is a project for the implementation of a type of computer graphics - path tracing.
The program has a camera object that controls POV, and primitives directly with which you can build a scene.

# Suported primitives üìê

```c++
int object_type;
/*
0. sphere
1. box
2. plane
*/
```
# Suported materials
```c++
int type;
/*
0. default
1. lamp
*/
vec3 color;
float Roughness; // shows how randomness will be next ray direction reflected or refract
float Specular;  // shows how likely ray will reflect, instead of refract (affects only if Refraction != 1)
float Refraction; // refraction property of object
```
