# Path-tracing

This is a project for the implementation of a type of computer graphics - path tracing.
The program has a camera object that controls POV, and primitives directly with which you can build a scene.

# Suported primitives 📐

```c++
int object_type;
/*
0. sphere
1. box
2. plane
*/
```
# Suported materials
```c++
int type;
/*
0. default
1. lamp
*/

```
